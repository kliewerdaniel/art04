## Potential Research Questions

### Short-term Outcomes (0-6 months)

1. **Mental Health Impact**
   - How do PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores change pre/post program participation?
   - What volunteer engagement levels correlate with mental health improvements?
   - Are there gender differences in mental health outcomes?

2. **Artistic Productivity**
   - Does access to mentorship/supplies correlate with increased art production?
   - What types of volunteer support most benefit artistic output?
   - How does stable housing/social support affect creative process?

3. **Economic Stability**
   - What financial support levels prevent artistic burnout?
   - How do one-time vs. ongoing micro-grants affect outcomes?
   - What income levels enable sustainable art practices?

### Long-term Outcomes (6-24 months)

4. **Career Transition**
   - What percentage of participants transition to self-sustaining art careers?
   - How do professional connections made through the program support career growth?
   - What role does digital portfolio development play in long-term success?

5. **Healthcare Utilization**
   - How does program participation affect broader healthcare engagement?
   - What mental health interventions work best alongside art-based support?
   - How can we measure holistic health improvements from arts programs?

6. **Community Impact**
   - How do individual artist successes benefit the broader art community?
   - What ripple effects occur when established artists support emerging ones?
   - How can alumni programs maintain long-term support networks?

### Program Design Research

7. **Matching Algorithms**
   - What volunteer-artist personality/interests combinations work best?
   - How can we optimize mentor-mentee matching for maximum impact?
   - What volunteer training most effectively prepares them to help artists?

8. **Technology Integration**
   - How can digital tools enhance rather than replace human connections?
   - What data collection methods minimize burden while maximizing insights?
   - How can virtual reality/mixed reality support remote mentorship?

9. **Sustainability**
   - What funding models best sustain arts-based social programs?
   - How can programs balance growth with maintaining personal connections?
   - What metrics most accurately predict program impact and ROI?

### Equity and Access Research

10. **Diversity, Equity, Inclusion**
    - How do programs serve historically marginalized art communities?
    - What cultural considerations affect mental health assessment interpretation?
    - How can programs better serve disabled, LGBTQ+, and minority artists?

## Methodological Considerations

### Quantitative Metrics
- Standardized assessment tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7)
- Economic indicators (sales, employment, housing stability)
- Volunteer engagement metrics (hours, types of support)
- Long-term tracking (where participants are 1-5 years post-program)

### Qualitative Methods
- In-depth interviews (pre/post program)
- Focus groups with artists and volunteers
- Art therapy integration assessment
- Community partner feedback

### Mixed Methods Integration
- How quantitative improvements correlate with qualitative life changes
- Participant storytelling combined with outcome data
- Volunteer experience analysis vs. artist outcome analysis

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All assessment data encrypted at rest
- Participant consent required for research use
- Aggregate-only reporting for public statistics
- Researcher access controls on individual data

### Participant Autonomy
- Artists can opt out of assessments at any time
- Program participation not contingent on research involvement
- Participant input in research question development

### Community Partnership
- Local arts organizations inform research design
- Participants have voice in finding dissemination
- Research findings benefit participating communities

## Next Steps

### Immediate Research Priorities (2024)
- Longitudinal study design (2-year follow-up)
- Randomized control groups matching
- Multi-site collaboration for larger sample sizes

### Technology Development
- ML model validation for volunteer-artist matching
- Predictive analytics for identifying high-impact support
- Dashboard development for real-time program monitoring

### Policy Advocacy
- Evidence-based advocacy for arts and culture funding
- Partnerships with healthcare providers for integrated care
- Collaboration with housing organizations for comprehensive support
